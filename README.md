## Hello! 
Welcome to my first fullstack app!
## A History...
This app was initially created in vanilla Javascript with no frameworks or dependencies using localStorage! This code is still used for all html and styling.  
The front end was then combined into an express-generator app, which is where this repo begins! The localStorage code was commented out as it was replaced with MongoDB and socket.io for realtime functions.  
## What stack is this?
This is MERN with no R! Vanilla js baybeeee!  
MongoDB for database, mongoose, express.js, node.js, socket.io, dart sass and javascript!
